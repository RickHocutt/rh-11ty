I was fortunate enough to work as a member of a small team of developers that created the AutoZone.com mobile site. Myself and another designer created the user interface elements and designs based on wireframes and a prototype developed in Axure.

After the design comps were completed I developed a complete CSS, HTML and JavaScript prototype that was used to build the current site.
