I've been working closely with Carol Jackson and her staff to create and make continuous updates to the Families Matter website and social network accounts (Facebook business page, Twitter, and YouTube). The site is built on the Wordpress Content Management System. I developed a custom theme and a few custom plugins along with utilizing shared plugins to achieve the required look and functionality.

The full site can be viewed at [FamiliesMatterMemphis.org](http://familiesmattermemphis.org/)
